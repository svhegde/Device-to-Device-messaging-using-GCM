# Device-to-Device-messaging-using-GCM
  In this example sending device to device (Mobile To Mobile) messaging using google cloud messaging (GCM).
  Here i am using HTTP based device to device messaging but Right way to achieve the device to device messaging is to implement GCM Cloud Connection Server (CCS).
  This communication is asynchronous and bidirectional(device to device).
